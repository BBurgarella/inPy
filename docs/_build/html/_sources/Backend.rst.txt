Backend namespace
=================

inPy comes with two backends currently used to preview the structure that you are working on
you can choose between Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/) which widely available but you might encounter performance issues
and Mayavi (https://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/) which features far better performance but you might have compatibility issues
(if, for example did not work for me when using remote desktop in windows)

if the future, I would like to provide an "inp" and "APDL" backend choice so that the end user can generate
structures both for Abaqus and Ansys
